This is a Solidity smart contract called "TokenBuyback" that facilitates the buyback of tokens using Ether (ETH) and distributes the ETH to two specified wallets.

Here are the key features of the contract:

1. The contract is based on the ERC20 standard and inherits the "Ownable" contract from OpenZeppelin.

2. The contract uses the Uniswap decentralized exchange's router interface to swap ETH for tokens.

3. The contract has two main wallets (wallet1 and wallet2) where the distributed ETH is sent. The distribution percentages for each wallet can be set by the contract owner.

4. The buybackPercentage variable determines the percentage of ETH sent to the contract that will be used to buy back tokens.

5. The tokenContractAddress variable represents the address of the token contract that will be bought back.

6. The contract receives ETH through the `receive()` function. When ETH is received, it triggers two internal functions: `buyTokens()` and `distributeEth()`.

7. The `buyTokens()` function swaps a portion of the received ETH for tokens using the Uniswap router. The tokens are sent to a burn address (0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD).

8. The `distributeEth()` function splits the remaining ETH after the buyback between wallet1 and wallet2 according to the set distribution percentages.

9. The contract owner can update the wallet addresses, buyback percentage, distribution percentages, token contract address, and Uniswap router address through various setter functions.

10. The contract owner can also withdraw any ERC20 tokens held by the contract using the `withdrawToken()` function, and withdraw the remaining ETH balance using the `withdrawETH()` function.

11. The `getBalance()` function returns the current ETH balance of the contract, and the `getTokenBalance()` function returns the token balance for a given token address held by the contract.

12. The contract emits events (`TokensBoughtBack` and `EthDistributed`) to provide information about token buybacks and ETH distribution.
